# Email-Spam-Classifier

    Spam Classifier with *Naive Bayes*, built using Python modules.

This project classifies the email as spam or not based on the scanning of the email body. The program compares the string tokens
with that of already stored *spam-keywords* and if it finds the one then reports the mail as spam otherwise not. 

If classified as spam will place in spam folder or give label of spam.  If not spam will show in inbox as normal inbox message.
